## jQuery click event challenges

1. Click a link and pop open an alert that says "HELLO!"
2. Click a link that hides some *other* text on the page.
3. Click a link that toggles showing and hiding some text on the page.
4. Create a "show movie spoiler" link (the movie spoiler is hidden, shows when the link is clicked, then hides when the link is clicked again)
5. ANIMATE #4 (it could fade, slide, or do something else super cool)

**BONUS:** Change the text on click and then change it back on the next click (for example, the link says "show" and then changes to "hide" on click and then back to "show" on the next click)
